To convert the given Java 8 code to Java 20 while ensuring best practices, we can take advantage of some of the newer features and improvements introduced in Java 11 to Java 20. However, the specific code snippet provided doesn't take full advantage of newer Java features, so the conversion primarily focuses on following best practices in terms of performance, security, and compliance.

Here is the converted and improved version of the code:



### Explanation:
1. **Exception Handling**: Instead of declaring `throws Exception` in the `main` method, I've used a `try-catch` block to handle exceptions locally. This is generally a better practice as it keeps the exception handling close to where the exception might occur and allows more granular control over the error handling.
   
2. **Using `join()`**: The `join()` method is used instead of `get()` to avoid dealing with checked exceptions. `join()` throws an `UncheckedExecutionException` if the computation threw an exception, which is a subclass of `RuntimeException`, making it easier to handle without needing to declare the method as `throws Exception`.

3. **Try-with-Resources**: Although `CompletableFuture` does not implement `AutoCloseable`, I used a `try-with-resources` statement to demonstrate how you might handle resources in a more modern way. Note that this is not applicable to `CompletableFuture` itself, but it's a common pattern in Java 20 and beyond for managing resources.

4. **Code Readability**: The code is structured to be more readable and maintainable, with clear exception handling and separation of concerns.

This code is now compliant with best practices for Java 20, including proper exception handling and leveraging modern language features.
