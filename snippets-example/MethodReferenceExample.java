// Java 20: Method references with var for type inference
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class MethodReferenceExample {

The provided Java 8 code already utilizes a feature introduced in Java 8—method references—and there are no direct changes required for Java 20 in terms of syntax or functionality for this specific example. However, I can provide some best practices and modern features that you might consider adopting in your Java 20 code:

1. **Use `var` for local variable type inference:** Java 10 introduced the `var` keyword for local variable type inference, which can make your code cleaner and more readable. However, use it judiciously as it can reduce the readability if the type is not obvious.

2. **Use `String.isBlank()` instead of `String.isEmpty()` for checking empty or whitespace-only strings:** Although this doesn't apply to your example, it's a good practice to be aware of. `String.isBlank()` is available from Java 11 and checks if the string is empty or contains only whitespace characters.

3. **Use `Stream` API enhancements:** Java 11 and later versions introduced several enhancements to the Stream API, such as `Stream.dropWhile()`, `Stream.takeWhile()`, and `Stream.ofNullable()`. However, these aren't applicable to your current example.

4. **Use `Text Blocks` for multi-line strings:** Java 13 introduced Text Blocks, which can be used for multi-line strings. This is useful for SQL queries, JSON strings, HTML content, etc. Again, this doesn't apply to your example but is good to know.

5. **Use `Pattern` and `Matcher` enhancements:** Java 20 introduced enhancements to the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes to support more complex regex operations.

6. **Use `Record` classes:** Java 14 introduced records, which are a special kind of class that is immutable and is typically used for data carrier classes. However, this doesn't apply to your example but is a modern feature you might consider using in other parts of your application.

For your specific example, the only modification you can consider is using `var` for type inference, which makes the code slightly more concise:



This version uses `var` for the list variable, which makes the code slightly more concise. However, note that `var` should be used only when the type is clear from the context to maintain readability.
