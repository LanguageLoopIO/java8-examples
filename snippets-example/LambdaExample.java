Converting the provided Java 8 code to Java 20 primarily involves leveraging the latest features and best practices introduced in Java 20. However, since Java 20 is a relatively recent release, and the code snippet provided is quite simple and already aligns well with Java 8 practices, there aren't many changes required. Nevertheless, I will ensure the code adheres to modern best practices and make use of any new features where applicable.

Here's the updated Java 20 version:



### Key Considerations and Best Practices for Java 20:

1. **Lambda Expressions**: The lambda expression usage is already optimal and aligns with Java 20 standards. Java 20 does not introduce any new enhancements specifically for lambda expressions that would change this usage.

2. **Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters**: Introduced in Java 11, this feature allows you to use the `var` keyword for lambda parameters. While it is not necessary in this simple example, it can improve readability and maintainability in more complex cases. Here’s how you could apply it:

    
    
    In this particular code, since the lambda does not use the parameter, it remains unchanged.

3. **Records**: Introduced in Java 14 and further enhanced in later versions, records are a new data carrier type for classes that are primarily used to store data. They are not applicable in this example, as it doesn’t involve data encapsulation.

4. **Pattern Matching**: Java 20 introduced pattern matching for switch expressions, but this is not applicable in the current code.

5. **Virtual Threads**: Java 19 introduced Project Loom, which includes virtual threads (fibers). While this could be useful in concurrent applications, it does not apply to this simple example.

6. **Performance and Security**: Ensure that the application is compliant with the latest security patches and that performance is optimized where necessary. However, for this simple lambda example, these considerations are not directly applicable.

7. **Code Style and Readability**: The code is already quite readable and follows modern Java practices. Ensuring consistent indentation, meaningful variable names, and comments where necessary is important.

In conclusion, while the original code is already well-structured and aligns with modern Java practices, the use of `var` for lambda parameters in more complex scenarios is a modern Java feature worth considering. For the provided example, no significant changes were necessary to convert it to Java 20 standards.
