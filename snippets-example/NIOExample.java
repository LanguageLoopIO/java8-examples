To convert the provided Java 8 code to Java 20 while ensuring modern Java features, best practices, and compliance, we can take advantage of improvements in the `java.nio.file` API and modern language constructs introduced in recent Java versions. Java 20 doesn't introduce major changes specifically for NIO, but we can modernize the code with features like `var` for local variable type inference and `try-with-resources` for better resource handling.

Here is the updated code:



### Key Upgrades and Best Practices:
1. **`Path.of`**:
   - Replaces `Paths.get` (introduced in Java 11). It is more modern and concise, although functionally equivalent.

2. **`Files.writeString`**:
   - Introduced in Java 11, `Files.writeString` simplifies writing a `String` to a file compared to manually converting it to bytes with `getBytes()`.

3. **`var`**:
   - Introduced in Java 10, allows local variable type inference, making the code more concise and readable.

4. **`try-with-resources`**:
   - Although not strictly necessary for this example, it is a best practice to handle resources in a way that ensures they are closed properly. Here, it's used to encapsulate all operations in a `try` block with robust error handling.

5. **Improved Exception Handling**:
   - Clear and meaningful exception handling is added to make the program more robust and production-ready.

6. **Console Output**:
   - Added a success message to confirm the operation and improve user feedback.

This code is compliant with modern Java standards and practices while leveraging features available up to Java 20.
