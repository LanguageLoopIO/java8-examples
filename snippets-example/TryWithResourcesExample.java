To convert the provided Java 8 code to Java 20, we can take advantage of modern Java features while adhering to best practices for performance, security, and compliance. Although `try-with-resources` syntax remains largely the same in Java 20, some improvements can be made, such as using `var` for local variable type inference (introduced in Java 10) to make the code more concise and readable.

Here's the converted code for Java 20:



### Key Changes:
1. **`var` for Local Variable Type Inference**: 
   - Introduced in Java 10, `var` allows the compiler to infer the type of the variable, making the code more concise and readable.
   - Used `var` for both `BufferedReader` and the `line` variable.

2. **Improved Exception Handling**: 
   - Added a more user-friendly error message (`System.err.println`) to provide better context if an exception occurs, in addition to printing the stack trace.

### Rationale:
- The `try-with-resources` syntax in Java 20 remains the same as in Java 8 and continues to automatically close resources.
- Using `var` modernizes the code and aligns with best practices in newer versions of Java, making it easier to read and maintain.

This code is fully compatible with Java 20, adheres to modern practices, and maintains clarity.
