To convert the provided Java 8 code to Java 20, we can take advantage of some of the newer features and best practices introduced in later Java versions. While Java 20 does not introduce any specific features directly related to the `try-with-resources` statement, we can enhance the code by using modern practices such as:

1. **String Handling**: Use `String.isBlank()` if there is a need to check if the line is blank.
2. **Logging**: Use `java.util.logging` or `SLF4J` for better logging instead of `e.printStackTrace()`.
3. **Try-with-resources enhancements**: Although Java 9 and later versions allow for more complex try-with-resources, the existing usage is already optimal in Java 8 and can remain the same in Java 20.

Hereâ€™s the revised code following these best practices:



### Explanation:
- **Logging**: Replaced `e.printStackTrace()` with a more structured logging approach using `java.util.logging.Logger`. This makes the error handling more professional and allows for better control over logging levels and output formats.
- **String Handling**: Added a check to see if the line is not null and not blank using `String.isBlank()`, which is available from Java 11. This provides a better way to handle lines that are empty or contain only whitespace.

This code adheres to best practices for Java 20 by using modern logging and string handling techniques.
