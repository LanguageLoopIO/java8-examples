Converting the given Java 8 code to Java 20 doesn't require significant changes because the `String.format` method has been part of Java since Java 1.5. However, to adhere to best practices and leverage modern Java features, we can consider using `String::formatted` which was introduced in Java 15 and further improved in Java 20. This method provides a more fluent and object-oriented approach to string formatting. Here's how you can rewrite the code:



### Explanation:
1. **Use of `String::formatted`:** This method is a more modern approach to string formatting introduced in Java 15. It provides a cleaner and more fluent syntax, avoiding the need to call `String.format` as a static method.

2. **Performance and Readability:** The `formatted` method is often more readable and can be more performant in certain scenarios, especially when dealing with more complex string manipulations.

3. **Compliance and Security:** There are no specific compliance or security issues related to string formatting in this context. However, always ensure that any string formatting does not inadvertently expose sensitive information.

By using `String::formatted`, the code is not only compliant with modern Java standards but also adheres to best practices in terms of readability and maintainability.
