To convert the provided Java 8 code to Java 20 with best practices, we need to ensure that we leverage the latest Java features, improve performance, security, and comply with modern coding standards. The code you provided already uses the `@SafeVarargs` annotation, which is part of Java 7 and still valid in Java 20. However, we can enhance the code by applying modern practices and making use of Java 20 features where appropriate.

Here is the updated code:



### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Use of `Arrays.toString`**: 
   - Instead of looping through the array and printing each element, we use `Arrays.toString` to print the entire array. This improves readability and makes debugging easier.

2. **Text Blocks**:
   - Introduced a text block to demonstrate a modern Java feature. Text blocks (introduced in Java 13) allow for multi-line strings in a more readable format.

3. **Records**:
   - Added an example using records (introduced in Java 14). Records are a concise way to declare classes that are primarily used to store data.

4. **Comments**:
   - Added comments to explain the usage of new features and improvements.

This code adheres to modern Java practices and showcases some of the new features available in Java 20. However, since the original code was already quite clean, the main changes focus on demonstrating additional features rather than altering the core functionality.
