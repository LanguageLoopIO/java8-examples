// Java 20: Functional Interface
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunction {
    int apply(int x, int y);
}

public class FunctionalInterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var sum = (MyFunction) (a, b) -> a + b;
        System.out.println(sum.apply(5, 10));  // Outputs 15
    }

To convert the provided Java 8 code to Java 20, we can leverage several new features and best practices introduced in the later Java versions. However, the provided code is already quite clean and makes use of functional interfaces, which have been part of Java since Java 8. Therefore, there are not many changes required in terms of functionality.

Here are some best practices and modern Java features we can incorporate:

1. **Use `var` for local variable type inference**: Introduced in Java 10, `var` can be used to infer the type of local variables, making the code more concise and readable.
2. **Text Blocks**: Although not directly applicable here, it's good to be aware of this feature for multi-line string literals.
3. **Switch Expressions**: Not applicable in this specific code, but it's a powerful feature introduced in Java 12.
4. **Records**: Not directly applicable here, but they can be used for immutable data carriers.
5. **Sealed Classes**: Not applicable here, but they can be used to restrict which other classes or interfaces may extend or implement them.
6. **Pattern Matching**: Not applicable here, but it can be used for more expressive type checks and assignments.
7. **Scoped Values**: Not applicable here, but it allows to associate values with the current thread or scope, useful for context propagation.

Given the provided code, the primary change would be to use `var` for local variable type inference. Here's the updated code:



### Explanation:
- **`var`**: Used to infer the type of the `sum` variable. Although it's not strictly necessary here, it's a good practice to use `var` when the type is obvious from the context.
- **Explicit Cast to `MyFunction`**: Adding an explicit cast to `MyFunction` makes it clear that the lambda expression is being assigned to a variable of type `MyFunction`. This is optional but can improve code readability.

This code remains functionally the same as the Java 8 version but adheres to modern Java best practices.
