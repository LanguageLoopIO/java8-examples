To convert the given Java 8 code to Java 20, we need to ensure that we are leveraging the latest features and best practices of Java 20. However, the core functionality of the code (using constructor references with `Supplier`) remains the same as it's a feature introduced in Java 8 and is still valid in Java 20.

Here's the same code with a focus on modern best practices and ensuring compatibility with Java 20:



### Key Points:
1. **Constructor Reference**: The usage of `StringBuilder::new` as a `Supplier<StringBuilder>` is already an example of a concise and efficient way to instantiate objects without explicitly using the `new` keyword. This hasn't changed in Java 20.

2. **Supplier Interface**: The `Supplier` interface is part of the `java.util.function` package and is used to represent operations that supply results of a given type. It is a functional interface with a single abstract method `get()`.

3. **StringBuilder**: `StringBuilder` is used for creating mutable sequences of characters. It is more efficient than `String` when you need to perform a lot of modifications.

4. **Code Readability**: The code is already quite readable and follows Java conventions. We haven't changed the logic or the structure of the code.

### Additional Best Practices:
- **Use of Local Variables**: We are using local variables (`supplier` and `sb`) to store intermediate results, which is a good practice.
- **String Concatenation**: In this particular example, `StringBuilder` is used for concatenation, which is more efficient than using `+` for multiple concatenations in a loop or complex scenarios. However, for a single concatenation, `+` is perfectly fine.

Java 20 does not introduce any new language features that would significantly alter this code. The focus remains on the correct use of existing language features and best practices.
