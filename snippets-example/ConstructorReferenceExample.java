// Java 20: Constructor references with best practices

import java.util.function.Supplier;

/**
 * This example demonstrates the usage of constructor references in Java.
 * It creates a StringBuilder instance using a constructor reference and appends a string to it.
 */
public class ConstructorReferenceExample {

    /**
     * Main method to demonstrate the usage of constructor references.
     *
     * @param args Command-line arguments (not used in this example).
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using constructor reference to create a Supplier for StringBuilder
        Supplier<StringBuilder> supplier = StringBuilder::new;

        // Getting a new StringBuilder instance from the supplier
        var sb = supplier.get();

        // Appending a string to the StringBuilder
        sb.append("Constructor Reference!");

        // Printing the result
        System.out.println(sb.toString());

To convert the given Java 8 code to Java 20 with best practices, we can utilize modern Java features and ensure compliance with current standards. However, the core functionality of the code does not require many changes since constructor references were already available in Java 8. 

Here are some best practices and minor improvements we can consider:

1. **Use Text Blocks**: If the string to be appended is complex, using text blocks can improve readability. However, in this case, the string is quite simple, so this is not necessary.
2. **Use Local-Variable Type Inference (`var`)**: Introduced in Java 10, `var` can make the code more concise and readable.
3. **Add Comments and Documentation**: Although the code is simple, adding comments and documentation can help others understand the purpose of the code.
4. **Consider Encapsulation and Reusability**: Even though this example is simple, it's good practice to think about how the code could be reused or extended.

Here's the updated code with the best practices applied:



### Explanation of Changes:
- **Local-Variable Type Inference (`var`)**: Replaced `StringBuilder sb` with `var sb` to make the code more concise.
- **Javadoc Comments**: Added Javadoc comments to the class and main method to explain their purpose.
- **No Functional Changes**: The core functionality remains the same, ensuring backward compatibility and correctness.

This code adheres to modern Java best practices and maintains readability and maintainability.
