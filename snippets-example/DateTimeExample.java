// Java 20: Enhanced Date-Time Example with Modern Features
import java.time.LocalDate;

public class DateTimeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using 'var' for type inference
        var date = LocalDate.now();

        // Using System.Logger for better logging
        var logger = System.getLogger(DateTimeExample.class.getName());
        logger.log(System.Logger.Level.INFO, "Current date: " + date);
    }

The original code is already using the `java.time` package, which was introduced in Java 8 and remains a best practice for working with dates and times in modern Java. However, in Java 20, we can enhance the code by making use of modern features such as `var` for type inference (introduced in Java 10) and `System.Logger` (introduced in Java 9) for better logging practices.

Here is the updated code, rewritten for Java 20:



### Key Changes:
1. **`var` for Type Inference**:
   - Introduced in Java 10, `var` allows for cleaner code by inferring the type of the variable from the context. While it doesn't change performance or behavior, it improves readability and reduces boilerplate.

2. **`System.Logger` for Logging**:
   - Starting from Java 9, `System.Logger` provides a more modern and robust logging mechanism compared to `System.out.println`. It's a structured way to handle log messages, making it easier to scale and integrate with logging frameworks.

This updated code is optimized for Java 20, adheres to modern practices, and ensures maintainability.
