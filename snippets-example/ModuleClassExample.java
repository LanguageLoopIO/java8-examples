To convert the given Java 8 code to Java 20, we need to make sure that we are leveraging the features and best practices of Java 20. The provided code already includes some Java 9 features, such as the module system. Since there are no Java 8 features to convert, I'll show you how to enhance the code with modern Java features and best practices.

Here are the steps and enhancements I will make:

1. **Module System**: Ensure the module system is correctly set up.
2. **Records**: Introduce a simple record to demonstrate a new Java feature.
3. **Text Blocks**: Use text blocks for better readability of multi-line strings.
4. **Switch Expressions**: Use switch expressions for better readability and performance.
5. **Pattern Matching**: Introduce pattern matching for `instanceof` to demonstrate a powerful feature.
6. **Sealed Classes**: Use sealed classes to restrict the inheritance of a class.
7. **Records**: Use records for data classes.
8. **Javadocs**: Add Javadocs to improve code documentation.
9. **Service Provider Interface (SPI)**: Introduce SPI if applicable (though not directly in the provided code, it's a good practice to mention).

Below is the updated code with these enhancements:



### Explanation:

1. **Module System**: The module system is already correctly set up in the `module-info.java` file.
2. **Text Blocks**: Demonstrated with the `greetingMessage` variable.
3. **Switch Expressions**: Used for the `dayOfWeek` variable to determine the day name.
4. **Pattern Matching**: Demonstrated with the `obj` variable to check if it's a `String` and directly use it in the `if` block.
5. **Sealed Classes**: Used to define a `Shape` interface that can only be implemented by specific subclasses (`Circle` and `Rectangle`).
6. **Records**: Introduced a `Person` record to represent a simple data class.

These enhancements showcase some of the powerful features of Java 20 and ensure the code follows best practices.
