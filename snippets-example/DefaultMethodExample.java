Converting the provided Java 8 code to Java 20 primarily involves leveraging newer Java features and best practices, while ensuring the code remains clean, secure, and performant. Since the code is already quite straightforward and uses a default method in an interface, the primary focus will be on demonstrating Java 20 features. However, note that Java 20 does not introduce any groundbreaking changes specifically targeting default methods in interfaces. Nonetheless, we can still improve the code slightly by adopting modern practices and preparing for future enhancements.

Here's how you can refactor the given code for Java 20:



### Key Changes and Best Practices:

1. **Text Blocks**: Introduced in Java 13, text blocks provide a more readable and convenient way to handle multi-line strings. This can be useful if the greeting message were to expand in the future.

2. **Variable Declaration**: Declared the `DefaultMethodExample` instance with a variable name instead of using an anonymous instance. This makes the code slightly more readable and easier to debug.

3. **Preparation for Future Enhancements**: Although not directly applicable here, it's good to be aware that Java 20 introduced sealed classes and patterns (preview features in Java 17 and 19, respectively), which can be used to create more robust and maintainable class hierarchies.

4. **Immutability and Records**: If the class or interface were to store state, using records (introduced in Java 14) could make the code more concise and ensure immutability. However, since the original class does not store any state, this is not applicable here.

5. **Security and Compliance**: The provided code does not have any security or compliance issues, but it's always good to be aware of best practices such as input validation, secure coding practices, and using the latest security features provided by the Java platform.

This refactored code adheres to modern Java practices and prepares for future enhancements without altering the core functionality of the original Java 8 code.
