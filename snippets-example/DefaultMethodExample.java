// Java 20: Enhanced with modern features and best practices

// Sealed interface to restrict implementation, improving maintainability
sealed interface MyInterface permits DefaultMethodExample {
    // Default method remains as it is valid and useful for shared behavior
    default void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello from the interface!");
    }
}

// Final class implementing the sealed interface
public final class DefaultMethodExample implements MyInterface {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Use of var for local variable declarations (if applicable)
        var example = new DefaultMethodExample();
        example.greet();
    }
}

To convert the provided Java 8 code to Java 20, we should evaluate how modern Java features can improve the code while maintaining its functionality. Since the original code uses a default interface method, which is still supported in Java 20, we can enhance it with newer Java features like `sealed` interfaces and pattern matching (if applicable). However, this specific example is quite straightforward and doesn't require significant changes. Instead, we can modernize the code structure and ensure it follows best practices.

Below is the updated Java 20 version of the code:

### Java 20 Code:


### Key Changes and Improvements:
1. **Sealed Interfaces**:
   - Introduced a `sealed` interface to restrict which classes can implement the interface. This improves code maintainability and security by explicitly defining the hierarchy. Only `DefaultMethodExample` is allowed to implement `MyInterface`.

2. **`final` Class**:
   - Marked the `DefaultMethodExample` class as `final` since it is the only allowed implementation of the `sealed` interface.

3. **`var` for Local Variables**:
   - Used `var` for local variable declarations (introduced in Java 10). While this feature does not drastically change the functionality, it makes the code more concise and modern.

4. **Maintainability**:
   - The structure is updated to reflect current best practices for Java 20, making it more secure and readable.

### Why No Further Changes?
The default method in an interface is still a valid and widely-used feature in Java 20. Since the code is already simple and functional, only minor improvements were necessary to align it with modern Java features.
